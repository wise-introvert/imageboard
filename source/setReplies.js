/**
 * For each `post` having replies, creates a `post.replies[]` property
 * with the list of replies to this `post`
 * (either their `ids` or the actual `Post` objects).
 * The reply info is looked up from `post.inReplyTo[]` property.
 * The `expandReplies` parameter controls whether the `.replies[]` list
 * is gonna contain just the replying post ids or the posts themselves.
 * The default behavior is the `.replies[]` list just containing replying
 * post ids in order to prevent the `post` object from turning into a
 * circular JSON structure when it can't be tested via `deepEqual()` in tests.
 * @param {object[]} posts — Parsed posts.
 * @param {boolean} expandReplies — Pass `true` in order for the created `.replies[]` list to contain the replies themselves rather than just their ids.
