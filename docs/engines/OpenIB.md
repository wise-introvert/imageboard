# `8ch.net` API

`8ch.net` is built on [`OpenIB`](https://github.com/OpenIB/OpenIB) engine which is a security-focused fork of [`infinity`](https://github.com/ctrlcctrlv/infinity) enging which is a fork of [`vichan`](https://github.com/vichan-devel/vichan) engine which is a fork of [`Tinyboard`](https://github.com/savetheinternet/Tinyboard) engine.

`vichan` API is mostly compatible to [`4chan` API](https://gitlab.com/catamphetamine/anychan/blob/master/docs/4chan.org.md). For example, compare the official [`vichan` API readme](https://github.com/vichan-devel/vichan-API) to the official [`4chan` API readme](https://github.com/4chan/4chan-API): they're mostly the same.

### Differences from `vichan`

* `tim` is a 64-character string. Looks like a hash of some sort.

* Posts have an `fpath` property that can be `0` or `1`. It controls the URL ("file path") of the attachments. See [Attachments](#attachments) section for more info.

* Posts have a `bumplocked` property that can be `"0"` or `"1"`. For some weird reason, it's not a number but rather a string. "Bumplocked" threads are in ["autosage"](https://twitter.com/infinitechan/status/555013038839848961) mode. In other words, "bumplocked" threads never get bumped, even when someone leaves a comment.

### Post

`8ch.net`, being built on `vichan` engine, supports `email` property on Posts. If `email` is `"sage"` then the post is a ["sage"](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sage) (non-bumping) one.

### Attachment

`8ch.net`, being built on `infinity` engine, supports multiple attachments per post via the `extra_files[]` property of a Post.

For images, thumbnail extension is always the extension of the original attachment (even for `.gif` files). For videos, thumbnail extension is always `.jpg`.

If an attachment has `fpath: 1` property then its URL is `https://media.8ch.net/file_store/{name}{ext}` instead of the regular `https://media.8ch.net/{boardId}/src/{name}{ext}`, and its thumbnail URL is `https://media.8ch.net/file_store/thumb/{name}{ext}` instead of the regular `https://media.8ch.net/{boardId}/thumb/{name}{ext}`.

Thumbnail size is `255px`.

## Syntax

Message HTML syntax is:

* `<strong>...</strong>` ‚Äî bold text.
* `<em>...</em>` ‚Äî italic text.
* `<u>...</u>` ‚Äî underlined text.
* `<s>...</s>` ‚Äî strikethrough text.
* `<p class="body-line ltr ">...</p>` ‚Äî a line of text (comes with a "line break" at the end, like `<br>`).
* `<p class="body-line empty ">...</p>` ‚Äî "line break" (like `<br>`).
* `<span class="detected">...</span>` ‚Äî some `(((...)))` "blue" text (whatever that means).
* `<span class="heading">...</span>` ‚Äî "red" text (seems to be used for headings).
* `<span class="spoiler">...</span>` ‚Äî spoiler text.
* `<p class="body-line ltr quote">...</p>` ‚Äî quoted text (starts with a `>`) (comes with a "line break" at the end, like `<br>`).
* `<p class="body-line ltr rquote">...</p>` ‚Äî red quoted text, they call it "faggotposting" for some reason (starts with a `<`) (comes with a "line break" at the end, like `<br>`).
* `<span class="aa">...</span>` ‚Äî ["ShiftJIS art"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_JIS) or ["ASCII art"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art). Should use a "ShiftJIS"-compatible font like ["Mona"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Font) or "MS PGothic". Should preserve sequences of white space. Lines should be broken at newline characters (or to prevent overflow).
* `<a href="#p184569592" class="quotelink">...</a>` ‚Äî post link (starts with a `>>`).
* `<a href="...">...</a>` ‚Äî other links (the URL may be in any form: relative like `/a/thread/184064641#p184154285` or `/r/`, absolute like `https://boards.4chan.org/wsr/`, absolute-same-protocol like `//boards.4chan.org/wsr/`).
* "Advanced" users may potentially use some unconventional markup, so all unknown/invalid tags should be ignored by just displaying their content (which can itself contain unknown/invalid tags).

### Roles

If a comment has a `capcode` then it implies that the poster is a priviliged one. Possible `capcode`s:

* `"Admin"` for global admins
* `"Global Volunteer"` for global moderators
* `"Board Owner"` for board admins
* `"Board Volunteer"` for board moderators

### Get boards list

`8ch.net` allows their users to create their own boards which results in a huge amount of boards being returned from the `https://8ch.net/boards.json` API (about 20 000 boards total).

Because of that, `8ch.net` provides a lighter-weight API for getting the top-50-some list of the most active boards: `https://8ch.net/boards-top20.json`.

Example output:

```js
[
	{
		// Board ID.
		"uri": "pol",
		// Board name.
		"title": "Politically Incorrect",
		// Board description.
		"subtitle": "Politics, news, happenings, current events",

		// Is this board "indexed".
		// (whatever than means)
		// (maybe something like "searchable")
		"indexed": "1",

		// `1` for "Not-Safe-For-Work" boards.
		"sfw": "0",

		// The total count of posts made on this board.
		"posts_total": "13007534",

		"time": null,

		// I guess they weigh boards somehow in their list of boards.
		"weight": 0,

		// Board language.
		"locale": "English",

		// Board tags.
		"tags": [
			"/pol/",
			"politics",
			"news",
			"free-speech",
			"current-events"
		],

		// The latest post ID on this board.
		"max": "13007534",

		// The number of `/16` subnet ranges to post
		// on this board in the last 3 days (72 hours).
		// It is not a perfect metric and does not account for
		// number of lurkers (users who only read the board and do not post)
		// or the number of users sharing an IP range
		// (for example, all Tor users are considered one active user).
		// In the entire Internet, there are only 16,384 /16 ranges
		// (also known as Class B networks), with 65,536 addresses per range.
		// So, if /v/ or /pol/ has 3,000 ranges (active users), that means their
		// posters represent 18% of the possible number of ranges on the Internet.
		// Many ISPs only have one or two ranges.
		// https://8ch.net/activeusers.html
		"active": 3808,

		// Posts made in the last hour on this board.
		"pph": 287,

		// Posts made in the last day on this board.
		"ppd": 7664,

		// Average posts per hour on this board.
		// I guess it averages over 3 days (72 hours) or something.
		"pph_average": 329
	},
	...
]
```

### Links

For some reason, hyperlinks in posts on `8ch.net` have their protocol colon wrapped in `<em></em>` tag (example: `"http<em>:</em>//google.com"`). Perhaps this was done to prevent some kind of crawling or something. Google doesn't index `8ch.net` anyway.

### Get thread IDs list (and their latest comment dates)

This is the same as `4chan`'s ["Get thread IDs list (and their latest comment dates)"](https://gitlab.com/catamphetamine/imageboard/blob/master/docs/engines/4chan.md#get-thread-ids-list-and-their-latest-comment-dates) API endpoint, the only difference being that it doesn't have `replies` count, and also has comment author `id`s on boards that show comment author ids..
