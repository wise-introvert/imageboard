  // (users who only read the board and do not post) or the number of users
  // sharing an IP range (for example, all Tor users are considered one active user).
  // In the entire Internet, there are only 16,384 /16 ranges (also known as Class B networks),
  // with 65,536 addresses per range. So, if /v/ or /pol/ has 3,000 ranges (active users),
  // that means their posters represent 18% of the possible number of ranges on the Internet.
  // Many ISPs only have one or two ranges.
